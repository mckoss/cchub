# cchub - [ComputerCraft][] Github Code

This repo enables players to keep a collection of programs up to date (and share them)
from a github repository.

## Usage

In order to play [ComputerCraft], you need a modded version of [Minecraft][].  I've found that the easiest
way to set this up is to use a laucher that includes the mod in it - I use [Technic][], as it's
one of the most popular.  Technic contains a collection of different Minecraft modopacks in one.  The
[Tekkit][] modpack include ComputerCraft and some other nice mods that are useful.

You can start the [Tekkit][] version (scroll the left panel until Tekkit is in the middle,
and then click Play).

## Quick Start

A quick way to get started with ComputerCraft, is to add a turtle to your inventory (type E, type
"computer" or "turtle" in the item search box, and this right click to add it to your inventory.  Right
click the computer/turtle and type:

    TurtleOS 1.5
    > pastebin get XXXXX cchub
    > cchub connect mckoss

*(replace mckoss with your own github account username.).

cchub will then scan your cchub repository (http:github.com/mckoss/cchub) and install your
programs in the cchub/mckoss directory.
